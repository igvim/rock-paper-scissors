Rock paper scissors in JS!

Areas for potential improvement (in order of impact):
- Increment playerScore and computerScore with a single condition (if rock & paper)
- I currently count draws. Might simplify things if I don't, but also is nice to see how many you get
- If you want to change rps to some other things, you could template literal playerSelection in the roundResult. I like that the result message is specific to the choices though ("paper covers rock" etc)
